Summary
The creature sitting on Harry's bed is small, has bulging green eyes and
 bat-like ears, and is wearing a tattered pillowcase for clothes. Harry, still 
 shocked by its appearance, recognizes it as the thing that was staring at him from 
 the bush earlier that afternoon. The creature stands and introduces himself as Dobby t
 he house-elf, and Harry invites him to sit back down on the bed. Dobby bursts into noisy 
 tears at being treated like an equal by a wizard, and this noise causes the dinner party vo
 ices downstairs to falter slightly. When Harry comments that Dobby must not know many nice 
 wizards, the house-elf begins to bang his head on the window, explaining his behavior as a 
 self-inflicted punishment for speaking disloyally of his masters, saying that he 
was bound to serve them until he died.
