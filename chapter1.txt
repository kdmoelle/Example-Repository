Summary
At 4 Privet Drive, the Dursley family is arguing. Vernon Dursley bellows at his nephew Harry Potter because Harry's pet owl, Hedwig, is noisy. Dudley Dursley, Vernon's spoiled and obese son, clamors for more bacon. When Dudley demands the frying pan, Harry mutters, "You've forgotten the magic word," and the family erupts into chaos.

The narrator explains the reason for the hubbub about the magic word.
 Harry Potter is a wizard, staying with the Dursleys for the summer after 
 his first term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Upon Harry's 
 return from school, Uncle Vernon locked all of Harry's magical things—his spellbooks, 
 brookstick, wand and cauldron—into a closet. The Dursleys are "Muggles," 
 or non-magical people, and they were forced to adopt Harry when his own parents 
 were killed by the greatest wizard of their time, the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry 
 survived Voldemort's curse but was left with a lightening-bolt shaped scar on his forehead,
  beneath his unruly dark hair and above his usually broken glasses. For the survival of this
   powerful curse (thus destroying Voldemort's powers) and also for his scar, Harry Potter was 
   famous in the wizard world before he was even old enough to remember. Harry did not even 
   know himself to be a wizard until the previous summer, when Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper,
    arrived to whisk eleven-year-old 
Harry away to Hogwarts for his wizarding education.
